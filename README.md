# ArcaneRoom

**A custom C++ development suite, built from source.**  
ArcaneRoom is a lightweight IDE and code environment designed for full creative control — no bloat, no fluff, just raw power.

### 🔮 Features

- 🧠 Built from scratch in C++ with ImGui, GLFW, and OpenGL
- 💻 Custom windowing, tabbed editor, and file explorer
- 🧰 Designed for engine development and embedded tools
- 🧠 Future: AI assistant (`ArcaneAI`) embedded into the UI
- 🔒 No dependency on VS, Eclipse, or commercial IDEs

---

### 🌌 Vision

ArcaneRoom isn’t just an IDE — it’s the *mind chamber* of ArcaneVXN.  
Every tool is shaped by need, every window forged with intent.

This suite is designed to support:
- Game engine development (ArcaneEngine)
- Experimental tech (TempleCore)
- Standalone toolchains and libraries
- Long-term AI-enhanced creative engineering

### 🚀 Status

🚧 In active development.  
🧱 Core loop, editor, and file system are built.  
🧠 AI agent and scripting integration coming soon.
